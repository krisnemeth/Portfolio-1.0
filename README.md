# React + Vite + TailwindCSS

My first real-life React project.

I've built this portfolio to showcase my skills, projects and a bit of my personality. It was a great learning experience to build something real with React, and to style it with TailwindCSS. I've learned a lot about both technologies during this project, and I'm very proud how it turned out. I have ideas I've ended up not using in this version of the project, but I will definitely create a 2.0 version of it soon.

I've used React Router for navigation and the react-scroll package as well for smooth scrolling.
I wrote JavaScript for all functionality, especially for dark mode, and the custom navigation bar and mobile menu overlay. I used TailwindCSS for styling, which I really enjoyed.
